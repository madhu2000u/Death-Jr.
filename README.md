# Death-Jr.
Delta App dev Task 1
Normal Mode

Death has come for your help. For years Death has unchangingly performed his duty of reaping souls at exactly their pre-ordained time. However the time has come for him to step down and pass on the torch to his daughter. But being inexperienced as she is, Death’s daughter has a tendency to reap souls a few years early or a few years late. While Death could straight away inform her of the correct year of death, he wishes for her to hone her intuition. So he requests you to build an app for his daughter to use.

The app chooses an age from 1-100 and let’s her guess it. You give her indications as to whether her guess is lower, higher or if she’s made a correct guess
Basic:

    The game has one box and a button to enter the number and set it as the number she is supposed to guess

    The game has one box for Death’s daughter to enter her guess and a button to make her guess

    Upon a guess from her display whether guess was lower higher or if she made the correct guess.

    After x tries, the game is scored as her loss

Hacker Mode

The app works on whether the number of guesses made by Death’s daughter is equal to the optimal number of guesses.

    To confuse her you give her your phone in various ways. Design a different layout for Landscape and Portrait Modes

    Store the number of times she fails the Test and the total number of times she has successfully guessed the year of death

    Change the background color(gradient from red for very wrong to green for very right) based on how far off she was from the actual age to help her arrive at the exact age easily

Hackermode++++++

Point the phone at someone and have the app generate their year of death

NORMAL AND HACKERMODES ARE DONE :)

Turns out Hackermode++++ was a joke.
